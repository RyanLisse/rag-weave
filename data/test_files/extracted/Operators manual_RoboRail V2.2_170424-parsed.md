# RoboRail Operator’s Manual

## 2.3 Gas and compressed air supplies
Please refer to the plasma unit manual for gas and compressed air requirements.

## 2.4 Personal Protection Equipment
For safety reasons operators must wear:
- Safety shoes.
- Flame proof overall / clothing.
- Flame proof gloves.
- Ear protection.
- Safety glasses.
- Helmet (when using an overhead crane or entering the cell).

## 2.5 Fire prevention
Make the area safe before cutting, remove all flammable material within 35 feet / 10 meters. Keep a CO2 type fire extinguisher nearby. Let hot metal cool down before handling it or let it touch combustible materials.

## 2.6 Explosion prevention
Gas cylinders contain a gas under high pressure, if damaged a cylinder can explode. Handle and use cylinders in accordance with applicable national and local regulations.

Always:
- Use only cylinders that are undamaged.
- Use cylinders in an upright and secured position.
- Keep all gas equipment and parts in good condition, replace damaged or worn components.
- Use gas equipment for only the type of gas they are designed and intended for.

Never:
- Lubricate gas cylinders, valves or regulators with grease or oil.
- Use tools to open a stuck cylinder.

## 2.7 Ventilation
The exhaust gases from the fume extraction and dust collection systems must be removed from the work floor according to local health and safety regulations. HGG recommends these gases be released to the exterior. When cutting stainless steel HGG STRONGLY advises that fumes are ALWAYS released outside*.

The material being cut can be a source of toxic fumes or gases that deplete oxygen. Exhaust gases pose a health risk when they are not removed from the work floor. Wait until the smoke has been extracted before opening the cell door.

To reduce the risk of exposure to fumes:
- Remove all solvents from the metal before cutting.
- Use local exhaust ventilation to remove fumes from the air.
- Do not inhale fumes, wait a while to open the door to give fumes the time to leave the cell.
- Monitor or test the air quality at the site as needed.

Consult with a local expert to implement a site plan to make sure air quality is safe.

# 4 Storage

## 4.1 Storing the machine when it will not be used for an extended period of time

If for any reason the machine needs to be moved to a new location or decommissioned and placed in storage, please contact HGG for detailed advice.

## 4.2 Storage environment

For long term storage the machine should be placed in a moisture and damp free environment with an ambient temperature between 5°C and 40°C. A desiccant should be used in the control unit cabinets and other electrical components (in the event of extended storage change the desiccant regularly). Ventilate the area periodically. The floor should also be damp proof or damp-proof padding should be laid before storage.

Most parts of the machine are painted or coated to prevent rusting. However, some parts are exposed to the air and should be oiled or greased regularly for protection. Alternatively, spray the parts with oil and seal with plastic coating (in the event of extended storage check the parts regularly). Treat all exposed parts, pay particular attention to the conveyor rollers, the cylinder shafts and the infeed and outfeed storage. All hoses and cables should be shielded by protective covering to prevent damage.

---

# 5 Infeed table

The infeed table consists of sliders with arms to cut larger quantities of the same profiles in quick succession. Several profiles can be placed on the side load infeed table, which are straightened by the driven chains and arms. The sliders move one profile and place it on the bogies. Once over the bogies, the sliders lower, leaving the profile on the bogies, retracting the arms and return to their home position.

The conveyor can be controlled from the touch screen on the remote control, either in the material handling screen by selecting the conveyor or in the diagnostics screen under the conveyor tab.

| ![Slider and Arm](image1.jpg) | **Slider** and **Arm** Starting position: Infeed table is homed and arms are up. Load profiles approximately 4 inches (10 cm) apart. |

# 6 Operation

## 6.1 Before starting the machine, check that:
- All persons are clear of the machine.
- No maintenance work is being performed on the machine.
- All fixed covers are in place. Some can be removed for cleaning, lubrication and maintenance.
- The machine is free of jams and other obstacles.

## 6.2 Starting up the machine
The operation of the machine is divided into 4 phases:

| Powering on mode | Homing mode | Preparing mode | Profiling mode |
|------------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|

In order to use the machine for profiling the operator must go through these 4 phases from left to right. The machine starts up automatically. If an action is required, the machine will show this, with additional instructions, if needed. The button at the bottom center of the screen is always the next step. Its appearance will change according to the state of the machine. The user interface will only display buttons that are allowed to be clicked in that specific state to prevent confusion.

All 4 phases are described below and the steps that need to be taken are divided into 2 types.

1. Manual (M), an action is required from the operator (Orange).
2. Automatic (A), the machine performs this action automatically (Blue).

**NOTE!** The images used to visualize the user interface do not show the whole functionality of the interface and are primarily used as a guideline. Always assume that the given description below describes the actions that need to be taken.

# RoboRail Operator’s manual

## 6.2.1 Powering on mode
In ‘powering on mode’ the machine connects to the motion controller and performs several configuration checks on both hard- and software level to assure correct operation.

![Powering on mode](image_url)

1. **Connect compressed air, power & Ethernet to the motion controller to RoboRail.**
2. **Powering stage: when the software detects that there is a software update file in the USB stick, it will be unpacked after the power check.**
3. **Turn on all main and RoboRail switches.**
4. **Check if emergency stop switch is released (not flashing).**
5. **Connect user PC to the same network as the RoboRail and the motion controller.**
6. **Press the ‘start’ button (in the ‘motion’ tab) and the ‘power’ button in the bottom screen of the motion screen.**
7. **Go to next screen (F6).**
---
# 6.2.2 Homing mode

In homing mode the machine is calibrated. The steps that need to be performed when the machine has had a complete power-down differ from the steps that need to be performed when the machine has been running in idle.

![Homing Mode Diagram](image_url)

* **Visually monitor the arm because the movement is unsafe and is not restricted in the way in which it moves to its position.**
* **When the machine has not had complete power-down and it has already been homed, the homing steps are skipped automatically.**
* **Use the move, rotate, open and close buttons on the right of the screen to remove previous materials.**

# 6.2.3 Preparing mode

![Preparing Mode](image_url)

In preparing mode the machine calculates the cutting file. The machine sets the bogies to the appropriate height and the operator places the material on the bogies. The operator is also responsible for preparing the roller yaws. Another option is to eject the remnant when the operator wants to use a different material or just clear the machine from the material of the previous job. This is possible via the `Eject remnant` button.

# RoboRail Operator’s manual

* When a material is used which uses the same bogie height, this step is skipped to save time.
** Make sure the material is always placed on the front bogie.
*** The material should be moved to a position where it meets the (imaginary) red line in the image below.

![Image of robotic arm positioning material](image_url)

## Workflow

1. **Include order (V1)**: Select a new cutting file by pressing the "Open File" button and the select a file with the extension .xml or .dxf. It is also possible to use the "Open Last Loaded File" button.

2. **File calculation (A1)**: The machine calculates the file in order to create a cutting program.

3. **Prepare rollers/rails (V1)**: Select a rail and/or the appropriate way to roll the material.

4. **Trolley placement (V1)**: Move the trolley to a position where the material to be cut is placed. Make sure the material is in the correct position for the trolley (V1).

5. **Bogie height (A)**: The machine will set the bogie to the correct height.

6. **Place material on front bogie (V1)**.

7. **Material placed on bogies (V1)**: Place the material on the bogies**.

8. **Press "next piece" button**.

9. **Begin to move (V1)**: Carefully move the material to the opposite side of the machine. Make sure the material is in the correct position for the machine to cut and that it is not stuck or clamping***.

10. **In balance (V1)**: Press the "In Balance" button.

11. **Go to next state (A)**.

# RoboRail Operator’s Manual

![RoboRail Interface](image.png)

- **Automatic mode**, automatically perform the preparing approaching, profiling and retracting steps for all cuts. Operator only clicks 'finish profiling' on the bottom centre of the screen after profiling is finished.
- **Semi-automatic mode**, perform the preparing, approaching, profiling and retracting steps for one cut at a time. Operator clicks 'next cut' after each cut and 'finish profiling' once all cuts are finished.
- **Step mode**, operator must press 'next step' after preparing, approaching, profiling and retracting.
- **Select cut**, allows the operator to select a specific cut in the lists of cuts visible in the middle of the screen.
- **Finish profiling** takes the operator back to preparing mode.
- **Move cut**, allows the operator to manually change the torch position.
- **Move material**, allows the operator to move the material forward or backward and to retract the robot arm.
- **Open outfeed table dialog** allows the operator to tilt, raise, retract and extend the outfeed table manually.
- **Retract**, retracts the robot arm.
- **Dry run** performs profiling without cutting.

# 7 Converting to a different profile

| Channel                       | 3 x 4,1 3"x 1,41" | C12 x 30" 12"x 3,7" | UNP 50 50 x 25 mm | UNP 280 280 x 95 mm |
| Tube (RHS/SHS) max. ratio RHS is 1:2 | 1" x 1"    | 8" x 8"    | 25 x 25 mm | 200 x 200 mm |
| Pipe (CHS)                    | Ø 1"       | Ø 10"      | Ø 25 mm    | Ø 250 mm   |
| (unequal) Angle               | 1"         | 8"         | 25 mm      | 200 mm     |
| Flat bar min. wall thickness 10mm | 2"x 8/16" | 8 x1"      | 50 x 10 mm | 280 x 20 mm |

Material in Mild steel only

Rusty/dirty flat bars can cause damage to the machine and thus are not allowed.

Max. outfeed length for pipe and tube (RHS/SHS) is 8ft/2.500mm

In case outfeed length of Channels, Angles, or flats exceeds 2.500mm / 8 ft, a non-driven support conveyor is to be installed (customer supply)

Clamp your profiles using the appropriate accessories for the front chuck and rear chuck (trolley) mounted in the correct position. Tube and box sections can be clamped from the inside or from the outside.

## Operation conveyor mode check

When cutting angle, channel, flatbar you must cut in conveyor mode. When preparing the machine, a check will be performed on the loaded file. If it is one of these materials, the machine checks if the conveyor mode plate is present and if the outfeed table is at its highest position.

If it is not, the machine will ask to place the plate and to raise the table.

When loading a file with tube/square tube, the check will ask you to remove the plate and send the table down.

If you raise the table itself again with a tube/square tube and then go to cut a larger profile, the table will be sent down again so that you can't bump into the table with the material.

**Possible Jaw Mounting Positions on the Rear Chuck or trolley:**

# RoboRail Operator’s Manual

- Make sure the Plasma unit power is OFF before changing consumables.
- Use the provided tools when replacing torch parts.
- Do not tighten parts excessively, they will be heated during cutting, expand and become tighter, making them difficult to remove.
- When plasma cutting with oxygen it is important to keep the consumable free from grease and oil. Always wear gloves when replacing these consumables, the oils in your skin may cause damage to the consumables or the torch!

## 8.4 Preventive Maintenance

Periodic maintenance is necessary to ensure the reliability and safe operation of the machine. It is very important to keep the machine in perfect condition to:

- maintain the high quality of the cutting work
- have a minimum of down time
- work safely with the machine

The machine has to be cleaned and greased according to the periodic grease schedule, in the case of intensive operation according to the number of operating hours.

Plasma Unit and optional Dust collector must be maintained according to the operator’s manual.

# RoboRail Operator’s manual

If you actually turned the chuck manually to put it level, you must redefine the base location of the robot.

In that case:
- Continue with § 3.3 to do a base calibration of the robot.

| ![Image 1](image1.jpg) | ![Image 2](image2.jpg) |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Level on top of the front chuck; jaw no. 4 on top | Level on top of the rear chuck |

## 9.2 Alignment calibration of the chucks

Calibration of the chucks makes sure that the front and rear chucks are aligned with each other. If they are not aligned, it can have a negative effect on the cutting quality.

The RoboRail is supplied with a tube (L = 2 m, 120 x 120 mm*) as reference part. If this tube is not available anymore, you must take an alternative square tube – with very accurate dimensions – that you use as a reference part.
Dimensions of the alternative tube: min. 120 x 120 mm | max. 200 x 200 mm*

*For USA:
- dimensions of the reference tube are L = 7 ft, 4 x 8”, thickness = ¼”
- dimensions of an alternative tube must be min. min. 5 x 5” / max. 8 x 8”

To verify if alignment of the front and rear chucks is necessary, do the procedure that follows:
- In the Calibration menu: select the button **Alignment calibration**.
- Select **Continue**.

If you use the reference tube supplied with the RoboRail: **
- Enter profile width: 120.00 (mm) on the screen (or use the arrow keys to do so).
- Enter profile height: 120.00 (mm) on the screen (or use the arrow keys to do so).
- Enter **Submit values**.

**For USA, if you did not receive the square tube but the 4 x 8” tube or if you did not receive any tube:
- skip this instruction and continue with the next (“If you use an alternative square tube:”)
- enter the dimensions in mm (1” = 25.4 mm)

If you use an alternative square tube:
- Accurately measure the outside dimensions of the tube (height and width).

---
# RoboRail Operator’s Manual

- Enter the width and the height of the tube (in mm) on the screen (or use the arrow keys to do so). Max. value: 200 mm.
- Select **Submit values**.

## Subsequently:
- Select **Open front chuck**.
- Load the tube.
- Select **Close front chuck**.
- Select **Continue**.
- Select **Approach material**. The field **Laser value** on the screen shows a certain value.
- Use the switch [Y+] on the control panel of the trolley (or the arrow button ◄ on the screen) to move the trolley fully forward.
- Keep an eye on the **Laser value** on the screen and move the trolley to the rear with switch [Y–] (or the arrow button ► on the screen). Make sure that the laser beam continues to hit the material.
- Select **Finish**.

If the laser value changes more than 2 (mm) you must align the chucks.

## For the procedure to align the chucks:
- Contact the HGG service department.

## 9.3 Base calibration of the robot

Base calibration makes sure that the 0 point of the robot is actually the 0 point. It sets the correct position of the robot related to the entire system.

The RoboRail is supplied with a tube (L = 2 m, 120 x 120 mm*) as reference part. If this tube is not available anymore, you must take an alternative square tube – with very accurate dimensions – that you use as a reference part.  
Dimensions of the alternative tube: min. 120 x 120 mm | max. 200 x 200 mm*

*For USA:*
- dimensions of the reference tube are L = 7 ft, 4 x 8”, thickness = ¼”
- dimensions of an alternative tube must be min. (min. 5 x 5” / max. 8 x 8”)

### Before you start:
- Make sure that the conveyor mode plate is removed and that a regular chuck clamp is installed.

### For the base calibration of the robot, do the procedure that follows:
- In the **Calibration menu**: select the button **Base calibration**.
- Select **Go to step 1**.

### If you use the reference tube supplied with the RoboRail: **
- Select **Use default measurement tube**.

**For USA, if you did not receive the square tube but the 4 x 8” tube or if you did not receive any tube:**
- skip this instruction and continue with the next (“If you use an alternative square tube:”)
- enter the dimensions in mm (1” = 25.4 mm)

# 9.4 Tool calibration of the robot

Tool calibration makes sure that the robot exactly knows the position of the torch, including the distance of the torch above the material. This calibration procedure can be important if the torch is bent due to the heat of the cutting process.

## Before you start:
- Make sure that there is no material inside the cutting cell.
- Make sure that you have equipped the torch with 125 A consumables (♦ Image 3).
  (Consumables of 65 A are 3 mm too short for calibration purposes.)
- Make sure that the cutting cell is closed.

## In case of large cutting faults (>10 mm / ⅜”) before calibration:
- Put the robot in Slow mode (bottom left of the screen) so you can stop it before it hits the sensor or the robot cell.
- If this happens during the calibration process: push the Emergency button on the remote control to stop the robot.

## For the tool calibration of the robot, do the procedure that follows:
- In the Calibration menu: select the button Tool calibration.
- Inside the cutting cell: remove the cover of the tool sensor.
- Select I have removed the sensor cover and equipped the 125amp consumables.
- Select Continue.
- Select Start tool calibration.
  - Tool calibration consists of three moving and turning cycles to set the torch position offsets correctly. This value is automatically saved.
- Make sure that the laser beam touches the black (=upper) part of the torch (♦ Image 4).
  - If it touches the white (=lower) part of the torch: contact the HGG service department.

## When the tool calibration is completed:
- Select Done.
- Select Return to home.
- Install the cover of the tool sensor.
  - The torch position is correct.

## If the tool calibration of the robot did not solve the problem:
- Continue with § 3.3 to do a base calibration of the robot.

# 9.5 Calibration of the trolley

Calibration of the trolley sets the correct position of the trolley related to the robot. If the home position of the trolley is not correct, it can cause incorrect product sizes.

**For the calibration of the position of the trolley, do the procedure that follows:**
- In the **Calibration** menu: select the button **Trolley position calibration**.
- Select **Go to step 1**.
- Select **Home the trolley** to move the trolley to the rear.
- Accurately measure the distance between the rear of the trolley and the hook (◆ Image 5).
- Enter the distance (in mm) on the screen (or use the arrow keys to do so).
- Select **Submit values**.
- Select **Home trolley**.

**Subsequently, to make sure that the home position of the trolley is correct:**
- Accurately measure the distance between the rear of the trolley and the hook again.

**If the distance = 35 mm (1⅜"):**
- Calibration of the trolley was successful.
- Select **Return to home**.

**If the distance is ≠ 35 mm (1⅜"):**
- Repeat the calibration procedure.

**Subsequently:**
- Continue with § 3.5 to align the front and rear chucks.

For the calibration of the infeed position of the material, do the procedure that follows:
- In the **Calibration** menu: select the button **Infeed material position calibration**.
- Select **Continue**.
- Select **Home infeed** to put the infeed at its home position.
- Select **Home trolley** to move the trolley to the rear. This is a safe position of the trolley during the calibration process.
- Select **Continue**.
- Select **Infeed forward** and/or **Infeed backward** to move the infeed just after the centerline of the bogies (♦ Image 7). In this position the infeed sliders are at 1 to max. 5 mm (⅟₁₆ to max. ⅟₄”) after the center of the bogies.
- Select **Submit position**.
- Select **Finish**.
